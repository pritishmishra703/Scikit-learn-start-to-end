We Often don't take care of What is Happening Under the Hood of all this Algorithm but learning Mathematics is EQUALLY very Important or you will not be able to understand the Real World Problems but we make these Tough and Confusing things Easy To Grasp. The only Pre-requisite is that you should be very Enthusiast to learn this because a Lack of Concentration can end with Dangerous Results.

## What's the Playlist all about ?

In that youtube playlist I am making videos for those who want to learn Machine learning but my main moto is to teach all the 
mathematics stuff behind it or we can say what's happening under the Hood of this algorithms. I have used Animation that make learning very much easier!

First you will know all the Mathematics stuffs and we'll do math by hand then we will do the same with Scikit-learn and then we will make our ***OWN*** machine learning
Algorithm.
