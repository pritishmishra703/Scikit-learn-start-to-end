In this Repository, I have made Jupyter Notebooks of many Machine Learning Algorithms using Scikit Learn. 

My YouTube Channel where I make everyting related to AI: https://www.youtube.com/c/PritishMishra/videos

If you want to know, How this Algorithms works and want to go in Mathematical details see my this Repo: https://github.com/pritishmishra703/MLthon

If you want to know, How Deep learning Algorithms works see this Repo (I have just started making this):https://github.com/pritishmishra703/DLthon
